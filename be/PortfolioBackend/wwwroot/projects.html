I worked with a
                    team of professional software engineers to develop a desktop application for one of the company&#39;s testing software.
                    I was able to learn more about desktop development using C# and WPF, as well as gaining experience in working with version control
                    and participating in code reviews as the project was constantly evolving. The internship period also gave me
                    experience in working with a team of professional software engineers and exposure to practices within a company.
                    Although this was a project that I worked on independently, I had a mentor and supervisor that I would meet with
                    on a weekly basis to discuss my progress and any blockers that I had, as well as any other topic relating to
                    Software Engineering and the company. The internship was within a program that let me meet other interns and
                    get to their projects and experiences as well.</p> <h4 class="text-lg font-medium py-2">Impact</h4> <p>I was able to surpass expectations by being able to move past the original scope of the project, which
                    was to develop a prototype. Past this, I was able to develop unit tests and began the implementation of
                    environment files and UI before reaching the end of my internship. I was able to meet one of the company&#39;s
                    product managers relating to my application and other teams in order to give an application demo and gain
                    feedback in order to continue development. I was also able to document my progress relating to what the application
                    does and the research I needed to do in order to make it work. These documents were shared on the cloud where
                    my team would be able to read and pick up where I left off on the project. The git practices also left the
                    project in a state where it could be picked up by another developer and continue development.</p> <h4 class="text-lg font-medium py-2">Skills learned</h4> <ul class="list-disc"><li>C# and WPF</li> <li>.NET Ecosystem</li> <li>Visual Studio</li> <li>Version Control</li> <li>Collaboration with a professional team</li> <li>Code reviewing</li> <li>Experience in Agile Practices</li> <li>Documentation for developing applications</li></ul></div></div></div>  <div class="bg-red-900 p-4" data-svelte-h="svelte-soph9t"><div class="container mx-auto px-4"><div class="flex justify-between items-center"><div class="flex-shrink-0"><a href="/" class="px-4 py-2 text-white text-xl">Home</a> <a href="/projects" class="px-4 py-2 text-white text-xl">Projects</a> <a href="/" class="px-4 py-2 text-white text-xl">Contact</a></div> <div class="flex"><div class="text-white text-xl p-10"><p><a class="text-yellow-200 hover:text-yellow-400 underline" href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/swift_732250">Swift</a> Icon by:
